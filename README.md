Some little stuff for Arduino:  

 * Thermal Power
 * 'Ticks' Library
 * Water Tank Level

The 'Ticks' Library  
[The 'Ticks' Library](https://github.com/domoenergytics/Arduino/tree/master/%27Ticks%27%20Library) for Arduino allow to manage sensors like anemometers or flowmeters. 
<br />This kind of device regularly sends impulses, not necessarily very frequent, and counts on a certain period of time to deduce the frequency, then a wind speed or a water flow.
